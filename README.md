# Signal Server
Multi-threaded radio propagation simulator based upon SPLAT! by Alex Farrant QCVS, 2E0TDW. 

SPLAT! Project started in 1997 by John A. Magliacane, KD2BD

This server application will generate RF coverage predictions, producing either 2D profile plots (Point-to-Point) or 360 degree polar plots in WGS-84 projection as PPM Bitmaps. 

For detailed information and historical reference data related to this project see the SPLAT! documentation. This SPLAT! fork used to power CloudRF.com from 2012 to 2016 before it was replaced with a purpose built engine. Propagation models added to this project have been sourced from reputable academic sources and all efforts have been taken to ensure their accurate implementation. Not all models are ITU ratified and you use them entirely at your own risk.

WARNING: The accuracy of the output is directly proportional to the accuracy of the inputs and the time taken defining and validating them. 

## Quickstart with Docker

```
docker run --entrypoint ../utils/sdf/usgs2sdf/srtm2sdf signal-server
```

To run the utilities for converting srtm data, try a command like this:

```
docker run -v /Users/turnrye/srtm:/srtm -v /Users/turnrye/sdf:/sdf --entrypoint /bin/bash signal-server -c 'cd /sdf && (for i in /srtm/*; do /signal-server/utils/sdf/usgs2sdf/srtm2sdf $i; done)'
```

## Requirements
* C++14-conformant C++ compiler (GCC,G++ / clang)
* Build environment for C++ (linker, C++ Standard Library and so forth) 
* CMake v3.5 or newer
* Convert (part of ImageMagick)
* For some additional scripts: Bash and Python interpreter
* library pthread: POSIX threads library
* library bz2: The bzip2 runtime library
* library dl: Open and close a shared object - POSIX conform
* library z: zlib is a general-purpose lossless data-compression library
* Multicore CPU (optional but recomended)
* ~2GB Memory
* SRTM terrain tile(s) or ASCII Grid tile(s)

Signal Server is a very resource intensive multicore application. Only publish it for common use if you know what you are doing and you are advised to wrap it with another script to perform input validation.

Additional programs/scripts will be required to prepare inputs such as .hgt tiles (srtm2sdf.c), 3D antenna patterns (.ant) and user defined clutter (.udt) or manipulate the bitmap output (.ppm). More information can be found in the SPLAT! project.

### REFERENCE DATA
Signal server is designed for most of the environments and climates on Planet Earth but Polar region support is limited above extreme latitudes. (Svalbard is ok).

 It can run with or without terrain data and can even be used to simulate radiation of other EM emissions like light.

#### -sdf 
##### Directory containing Digital Elevation Models (DEM)
SDF formatted tiles can be created by converting SRTM tiles (30m or 90m) in HGT format with the srtm2sdf or srtm2sdf-hd utility. At the time of writing these tiles can be obtained for free from the [Viewfinder Panoramas website](http://viewfinderpanoramas.org/dem3.html).

Note these can be compressed using gzip or bzip2 if desired to save disk space and speed up loading the files.  For hi-res (HD) SRTM1 (30m) data, bzip2 compresses best, and for lo-res SRTM3 (90m) data, gzip seems to achieve the best compression.  Either will work fine for whichever data format and resolution is used.


#### -lid 
##### WGS84 ASCII grid tile (LIDAR) with dimensions and resolution defined in header
LIDAR data can be used providing it is in ASCII grid format with WGS84 projection. Resolutions up to 25cm have been tested. 2m is recommended for a good trade off. Cellsize should be in degrees and co-ordinates must be in WGS84 decimal degrees.

To load multiple tiles use commas eg. -lid tile1.asc,tile2.asc. You can load in different resolution tiles and use -resample to set the desired resolution (limited by data limit).

cellsize     0.000006170864
NODATA_value 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...
```

#### -udt 
##### User defined CSV clutter file
This text file allows you to define buildings with co-ordinates and heights.
Elevations in the UDT file are evaluated and then copied into a temporary file under /tmp.  Then the contents of the temp file are scanned, and if found to be unique, are added to the ground elevations described by the digital elevation data in memory. Height units are determined by appending M for meters or nothing for feet.

There is no special parsing for comments, so any lines of data that don't contain 3 numbers separated by commas are interpreted as a comment.

Format: latitude,longitude,height(M)
```
// This is a comment!

54.555,-2.222,10M

```

### Antenna radiation pattern(s)
Antenna  pattern  data is read from a pair of files having the same base name as the output file (-o), but with  .az  and .el  extensions  for azimuth and elevation patterns.  This name can be overridden with the command line option -ant followed by a base filename or path and base filename for the .az and .el files.  The program will first search for command line specified antenna files with -ant, then it will default to searching for antenna files having the same name as the output file.  
```
045.0
0       0.8950590
1       0.8966406
2       0.8981447
3       0.8995795
4       0.9009535
5       0.9022749
```
The  first  line of the .az file specifies the direction measured clockwise in degrees from  True  North.  This is followed by azimuth headings (0 to 360 degrees) and their associated normalized field patterns (0.000 to 1.000) separated by whitespace.  This direction can be overridden by the command line option -rot followed by a positive direction value from 0 to 360 degrees.  This value will override any direction specified in the first line of the .az file.  If not specified on the command line, the program will default to using the direction from the first line of the .az file.

The  structure of SPLAT! elevation pattern files is slightly different. The first line of the .el file specifies the amount of mechanical  beamtilt  applied  to  the  antenna.   A downward tilt is expressed as a positive angle, while an upward tilt is expressed as a negative angle.  This data is followed by the azimuthal direction of the tilt, 0 to 360 degrees, separated by whitespace.  These can be overridden by the command line options -dt for downtilt and -dtdir for downtilt azimuthal direction.  The options, like -rot above, will override any values embedded in the .el file if specified on the command line.

The remainder of the file consists of elevation angles and their radiation pattern (0.000 to 1.000) values separated by whitespace.  Elevation angles must  be  specified  over  a -10.0  to  +90.0  degree  range.  In  this  example,  the  antenna  is  tilted down 2 degrees towards an azimuth of 045.0 degrees.

```
### Scripting
By using wrapper scripts like runsig.sh and genkmz.sh, you can streamline running signalserver by pre-setting some commonly used options in the runsig.sh file.  Those options should be the ones you use every time you run signalserver, like "-m" for metric or "-sdf ./sdf_file_path", for example, so you won't have to specify those options every time you run it.  The genkmz.sh file will convert the output ppm file into a .png with transparent background, then will convert it to a Google Earth Keyhole Markup Language (KML) file, and then it compresses it for size to a (KMZ) file.  Here is an example of using the provided sample runsig.sh and genkmz.sh:
```
### Plot 70cm Service contour, 700W ERP, 300 feet AGL, DB413-B, to 150 mi:
